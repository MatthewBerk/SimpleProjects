# Collection of simple projects.

This is a collection of basic programs I wrote to keep myself coding every day when I didn't have work to do.

Several projects from this repo are inspired by the application ideas posted at this [repo](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas). Though the repo just stated ideas and requirements/features of application, no code.
